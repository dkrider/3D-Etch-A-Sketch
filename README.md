Abstract
========

This program acts like a "3D Etch-a-sketch in space essentially. I can't think of a better way to describe it at the moment. You are in some 3D space, and you can lay down blocks or erase them anywhere you move (forwards, backwards, up down, left, or right @ 1 block size unit at a time). This was a project for CS390A-Fundamentals of Games Programming @ MSUDenver, taught by Professor Jerry Shultz. 


Limitations
===========

This class crammed so much information into a 15 week session that we have not had the time to go back yet and clean up code, perform thorough testing, or even package correctly. We anticipate completing this project though, and would also be interested if someone else wanted to join in, contact us about it, or fork to thier own repos. This project is very much still incomplete. You would have to load an image and alter the code to reflect your images nam to get this to run, all problems that we intend to fix with a solid beta version hopefully coming by the end of the year.
